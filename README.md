# Copyist (frontend)

*Website live at https://aklagoo.github.io/copyist-frontend/*

This app makes cross-device text sharing a lot easier, by maintaining a shared textbox across several devices. A new ID is generated when you first open the website and is remembered every time you reopen it. Want to use it on another device? Just copy the link once.

## Libraries

It has been built with React, NodeJS and SocketIO.

## Deploying it yourself?

Host the code [here](https://github.com/aklagoo/copyist-backend) as your backend, and run the current repository as your frontend.
