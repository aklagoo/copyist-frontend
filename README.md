This app makes cross-device text sharing a lot easier, by maintaining a shared textbox across several devices. A new ID is generated when you first open the website and is remembered every time you reopen it. Want to use it on another device? Just copy the link once.

## Libraries

It has been built with React, NodeJS and SocketIO.
